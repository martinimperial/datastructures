Facts
- Acessing a memory location or storing a val in a memory location is O(1).
- Acessing a value or stroing a value in a list is O(1) as well.
- The size doesn't change the time needed to access/store the val in mem/lst.

Here's some operations that take constant time to execute.
- Add two numbers
- Multiplication of two numbers
- Comparing two values

Basically, any arithmetic calculation or comparison can be
considered as a constant time operation.

Space/Time
- Space: the amount of RAM needed to solve a problem
- Time : measure how the number of operations grow as data size grows
